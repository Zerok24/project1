                    The Divine Comedy is an epic poem written by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, completed
                    in 1320. The epic poem is divided into 3 parts: Inferno, Purgatory and Paradiso. The 
                    Divine Comedy takes the reader into a journey in which Dante has to go through Hell,
                    and the Purgatory in order to get to paradise, which is the place where his beloved
                    Beatrice resides. Dante is not alone in this journey, he will be led by his admire
                    Roman poet, Virgil. Virgil was comissioned by Beatriz to hel Dante return to her presence.
                    While in his journey, Dante describes with great detail everything that he sees. 
                    Throughout his journey he often feels discourage to continue his journey, but if 
                    is always push to continue by Virgil and the reminder that he will return with 
                    Breatiz.

                    Inferno, which translates to hell in English, is by far the most popular section of the 
                    Divine Comedy. In fact, this section of the book was so influencial among the christian
                    faith, that a lot of the images, and ideas that we have today about hell come from this
                    section. Inferno is divided into 9 circles: Limbo, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Heresy,
                    Violence, Fraud and Treachery. The deeper the circle in hell, the greater the sin and 
                    therefore the greater the punishment. This part of the book was also the most controvesial
                    of all the parts of the book. So much so, that this will forced Dante into exile. Why? 
                    Because he questioned a lot of the beliefs of the catholic church at the time. Also,
                    Dante put a lot of the popes of his times in the deeper circles of hell.

                    Purgatorio, is the second step of Dante's trip to Purgatorio (purgatory). This part of the
                    book, is the most lyrical of all the parts. Purgatorio is divided into 7 circles:
                    Proud, Envious, Wrathful, Slothful, Covetous, Gluttonous, and Lustful. This 7
                    circles correspond to the 7 deadly sins of the catholic theology. In this part,
                    Dante witnesses how souls atone their sins. The difference between Purgatory and 
                    Inferno is that in Purgatory, souls have hope that they one day will go to heaven
                    to live with God, in Inferno, as the entrance remarked, there is no hope.

                    Paradiso is the final stop for Dante. In paradiso Dante finally reunites
                    with his beloved Beatriz. This part of the Divine Comedy is consider the 
                    most theological. Here Dante witnesses many well known Catholic characters
                    like St.Peter, St.Bernardo and even Jesus Christ. Paradiso is also divided into
                    different circles: Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
                    the Fixed Stars, and the Primum Mobile. The higher the cicle, the greter the 
                    glory.
