                <q>
                    When I had journeyed half of our life's way,
                    I found myself within a shadowed forest,
                    for I had lost the path that does not stray.

                    Through me the way to the suffering city;
                    Through me the everlasting pain;
                    Through me the way that runs among the Lost.
                    Justice urged on my exalted Creator:
                    Divine Power made me,
                    The Supreme Wisdom and the Primal Love.
                    Nothing was made before me but eternal things
                    And I endure eternally.

                    Heaven, to keep its beauty,
