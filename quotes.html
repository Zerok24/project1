                <q>
                    When I had journeyed half of our life's way,
                    I found myself within a shadowed forest,
                    for I had lost the path that does not stray.
                </q>
            </p>

            <h3>Canto III</h3>
    
            <p>
                <q>
                    Through me the way to the suffering city;
                    Through me the everlasting pain;
                    Through me the way that runs among the Lost.
                    Justice urged on my exalted Creator:
                    Divine Power made me,
                    The Supreme Wisdom and the Primal Love.
                    Nothing was made before me but eternal things
                    And I endure eternally.
                    <b>Abandon all hope - You Who Enter Here.</b>

            <p>
                <q>
                    Here one must leave behind all hesitation;
                   here every cowardice must meet its death.
                </q>
            </p>

            <p>
                <q>
                    Heaven, to keep its beauty,
                    cast them out, but even Hell itself would not receive them
                    for fear the wicked there might glory over them.
                </q>
